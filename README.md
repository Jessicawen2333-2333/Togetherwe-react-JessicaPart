# TogetherWe (React Native Modules by Jessica)

This repository contains the parts I implemented for a startup's mobile app built with **React Native (Expo)** and **Firebase**.  
The app aims to connect travelers and hosts through shared experiences.

## 🧩 Features I Built
- **Authentication Flow:** Sign in / Sign up screens with validation
- **Forgot Username & Country Code Picker** with reusable components
- **Photo Upload Integration:** Firebase Storage + Firestore updates
- **Image Compression & Progress Bar** using `expo-image-manipulator`
- **Registration Success Flow:** smooth navigation + UI redesign
- **Global Keyboard Dismiss Button** for accessibility improvement

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React Native (Expo)
- TypeScript
- Firebase Auth / Firestore / Storage
- Expo Router
- Expo Image Manipulator
